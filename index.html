		<b> ABOUT ME: </b>
		<br><br>
		I graduate in 2023 from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Biology with Science and Society. 
		This course gave me a traditional biological education with a unique historical, sociological and
		political perspective. I focused heavily on human healthcare, studying virology, vaccines and
		epidemics before specialising in neurotechnology, neuropharmacology and mental healthcare frameworks in the UK.
		Throughout my studies at Manchester, I built planning and organisational skills whilst exploring science
		communication through written and audio-visual mediums. This culminated in my final project where I created
		a video lecture about the ethical issues surrounding neurotechnology development. <BR> <BR>

		I have 2 years experience in the hospitality industry, working in a members restaurant and a high-volume bar,
		and over 4 years experience as a sports coach, teaching gymnastics and tennis to children from ages 3-16.
		Both roles have given me excellent customer service skills and confidence in communicating to different
		demographics. My aim for 2023 is to gain experience in a medical setting, refining my administration and
		professional skills in order to progress to a career in clinical research.
